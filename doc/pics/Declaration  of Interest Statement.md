# Highlights
 -  Neural Networks decomposed in Trees are easier to modify and monitor 
 -  Vision Transformers are Lipschitz continuous
 -  Neural Networks with residual structure can be understood by their underlying ODEs 
 -  Adversarial robustness of neural network is proved to be dominated by the Maximum Singular Value of Jacobian of the basic blocks
